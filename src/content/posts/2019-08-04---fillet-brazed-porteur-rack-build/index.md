After building a [commuter-mtb bike frame](/building-my-first-bike-frame) I wanted to make an accompanying front rack. I've been using a porteur rack by Velo Orange for the past few years but was never quite happy with it. It looks nice and is fine for smaller loads, but there's some noticeable flex when carrying larger loads (like my backpack on humid days). Its flex is due to a few factors. The lower struts connect at the fork dropout, which is too far from the platform/load. Also, the thin upper strut simply holds the rack in position, providing little to no actual support. These flaws aren't exlusive to the Velo Orange rack. Looking at photos, it seems many other racks suffer from similar flaws. The burliest production porteur rack I know of is the Surly 24-pack, but it's heavy and the attachment system is kinda sketchy (it was recalled). So, I decided to make my own.

## Design

<!-- TODO photo of glass design -->

I decided on these specs for my rack:
- Designed for my specific fork, the 2019 Surly Troll fork. It might work with other Surly forks.
- 3/8" diameter, .028" wall 4130 steel tubing. There's a great comparison of the ~six reasonable steel tubing dimensions for racks on Alex Wetmore's blog [here](http://alexwetmore.org/archives/501.html). I chose this tubing because it's about three times stiffer than traditional 1/4" tubing and only slightly heavier.
- No adjustment mechanisms, mounting directly to the fork in order to maximum stiffness and strength.
    - Upper struts connect directly to upper rack mounts (instead of brake hole).
    - Lower struts that connect directly to mid-fork rack mounts (instead of mounts at dropout).
- Platform should be just above the tire for low center of gravity for stability.
- 16x12" platform. About the size of a Wald 139 basket. Large enough to support a pizza box.

## Tools

- Cheap hand tube bender with 1" radius. These things are only meant to be used on soft metals like copper, so use at your own risk.
- 3/8" Nicholson Bastard File and bench grinder for mitering
- "Found tools" for fixturing, including a bench vise, mini vise grips, bent spokes, and string
- Bike/fork for final leveling and fixturing
- Oxy-acetylene torch setup
- Square

## Rack Tabs

Rack tabs connect the struts to the fork. There are some available from Framebuilder Supply and Rene Herse, but I decided to make my own. They're pretty simple. There's a rectangular end that fits perfectly into the end of the tube (using a "largest rectangle you can inscribe in a circle" calculation). The other end has a clearance hole for an M5 bolt and a nice radius/taper down to the tube's outer diameter. I drew them up in Inkscape (email me if you want the file). I then purchased some 1/8" mild steel sheet (A366/1008 cold rolled).

My friend Dante was leaving his job at Yale's makerspace so I quickly tasked him with cutting the tabs out on their waterjet. If you don't know what a waterjet is...well...check out an [anvil being cut in half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quL14Csmi_Y&t=132) by one.

They turned out great! Thanks Dante.
