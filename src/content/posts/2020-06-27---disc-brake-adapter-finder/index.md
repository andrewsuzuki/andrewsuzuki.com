I think almost every bike mechanic has accidentally ordered the wrong disc brake adapter at one time or another. I decided to make a simple online wizard to make it easy. Simply enter your frame/fork mount standard, caliper standard, and rotor size. It should return a list of possible adapters, or adapter combinations if necessary.
